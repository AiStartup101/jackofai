REPLIT UPDATE PROMPT (SAFE COPY UPDATE — /opportunities ONLY)

Goal:
Update ONLY the /opportunities page copy to better align with the new JackofAI positioning (calm consumer product company), WITHOUT breaking routes, deployment, domain, navigation, styles, or any existing links.

Hard rules:
- DO NOT change any routing, filenames, or folder structure.
- DO NOT rename the /opportunities route or remove the “Back to home” link.
- DO NOT modify next.config.js, package.json, build scripts, environment variables, or deployment settings.
- DO NOT change global layout components (Header/Footer) unless the /opportunities page imports them locally.
- DO NOT remove any existing sections/cards; only adjust copy and optionally add ONE short line near the top.
- Keep all existing Tailwind classes and component structure; only change text strings.
- Keep email address and any contact links exactly as currently implemented.

Scope:
- Edit only the file that renders /opportunities:
  - Next.js App Router: app/opportunities/page.tsx
  - or Pages Router: pages/opportunities.tsx
  - or equivalent route file currently used.
If you cannot find it quickly, search for the H1 text “Opportunities at JackofAI”.

Changes to implement (copy only):

1) Add a single positioning anchor line directly under the H1 heading:
Add this sentence as a short paragraph (same style as existing subtext, slightly lighter than the H1):
“JackofAI is a calm consumer product company building warm, human-centred AI apps.”

2) Update the intro paragraph (keep meaning; minor tighten):
Current concept: “We’re not a traditional hiring pipeline…”
Keep it, but ensure it reads as:
“We’re not a traditional hiring pipeline. We’re building a small network of people who enjoy crafting thoughtful digital products — and we collaborate in flexible, project-based ways.”

3) Update “For builders & creators” opening line:
Replace:
“Ideal if you like turning ideas into working products and experiences:”
With:
“Ideal if you enjoy turning thoughtful ideas into calm, human-centred products:”

4) Update “For experts & advisors” first sentence:
Replace:
“We welcome conversations with people experienced in…”
With:
“We welcome thoughtful conversations with people experienced in…”

5) Update “For investors & strategic partners” first sentence (soft de-emphasis):
Replace:
“We’re open to thoughtful early conversations with…”
With:
“We’re open to select, thoughtful early conversations with…”

6) Add one expectation-setting line in “How to reach us” section BEFORE the bullet list:
Add:
“We read every message, but respond selectively to conversations that feel aligned.”

Do NOT change:
- The “CURRENT PRIORITY NEEDS” list items (keep as-is).
- Any bullet lists of roles/categories other than the specific opening lines above.
- The email line: “Email: hello@jackofai.com”
- Footer copyright line.

After making changes:
- Run the site and confirm /opportunities renders with no errors.
- Confirm mobile layout is unchanged (no overflow, no broken spacing).
- Confirm “Back to home” works.
- Confirm email link remains correct.
- Run build/typecheck if available and fix any TS/ESLint issues caused by formatting.

Deliverable:
Commit the minimal text-only edits for /opportunities, leaving everything else untouched.
