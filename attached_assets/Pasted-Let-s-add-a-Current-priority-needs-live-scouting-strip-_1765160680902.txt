Let’s add a “Current priority needs” / live scouting strip inside the Work with us section:
Compact, not noisy


Looks like a set of pill badges


Easy for you to update by editing one small array in the code


Can include things like:


“React Native dev (short sprint)”


“LinkedIn partner / handler”


“Instagram & Reels collaborator”


“YouTube shorts editor”


“IP / patent advisor (apps / AI)”


Here’s a Replit-ready prompt to add it.

🔧 Replit prompt — Add “Current priority needs” / live scouting strip
Paste this into the Replit AI agent:
Hi Replit,

I’d like to add a small “current needs” / live scouting strip inside the
“Work with us: talent & collaborators” section so visitors can quickly see
what roles or collaborations are most urgent right now.

1) In `app/page.tsx`, near the top of the main component (just inside the component, above the return), add this array so it’s easy to edit later:

const currentNeeds = [
  "React Native developer (short sprint)",
  "Next.js frontend collaborator",
  "LinkedIn outreach / content partner",
  "Instagram & Reels social media collaborator",
  "YouTube shorts / video editor",
  "IP / patent advisor (apps & AI)",
  "Early adopters for ChristmasPulse & FamilyPulse testing"
];

2) In the “Work with us: talent & collaborators” section, directly under the intro paragraph:

<p className="text-slate-300 mt-4">
  We’re growing a small, intentional network of people who enjoy creating simple, human-centered digital products. 
  Whether you build, design, advise, invest, or test early ideas – we’d love to connect.
</p>

…add the following block before the grid of cards:

<div className="mt-4 rounded-2xl bg-white/5 border border-white/10 px-4 py-3">
  <div className="flex items-center gap-2 text-xs font-medium text-slate-200 uppercase tracking-wide">
    <span className="inline-flex h-2 w-2 rounded-full bg-emerald-400 animate-pulse" />
    <span>Current priority needs</span>
  </div>
  <div className="mt-3 flex flex-wrap gap-2 text-xs text-slate-200">
    {currentNeeds.map((item) => (
      <span
        key={item}
        className="rounded-full border border-white/15 bg-white/5 px-3 py-1 backdrop-blur-sm hover:border-sky-400 hover:text-sky-200 transition"
      >
        {item}
      </span>
    ))}
  </div>
</div>

3) Keep the rest of the section (the four cards and the “Share your details” block) exactly as it is.

This should create a small “live scouting” strip with pill-style tags that I can update just by editing the `currentNeeds` array.

Please save all changes and redeploy.

Thanks!

This gives you a live-feeling scouting system without any backend:
Any time your focus changes (e.g., “Urgent: LinkedIn partner” or “Looking for Australian IP counsel”), you just edit that array.


It visually tells people what you care about right now and nudges the right ones to reach out.
