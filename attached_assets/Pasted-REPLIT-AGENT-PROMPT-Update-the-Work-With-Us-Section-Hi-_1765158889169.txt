REPLIT AGENT PROMPT — Update the “Work With Us” Section
Hi Replit,
Please update the “Work with us: talent & collaborators” section of the homepage with the following compact, founder-ready content. Replace the old block with this entire updated version:
<h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-16">Work with us: talent & collaborators</h2>
<p className="text-slate-300 mt-4">
  We’re building thoughtful digital experiences and growing a small, intentional team. 
  If you enjoy creating simple, human-centered products — or if you have expertise that can help us build responsibly — we’d love to connect.
</p>

<h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-8">Talent & Creators</h3>
<ul className="text-slate-300 space-y-2 mt-2">
  <li>• App developers (React Native, Next.js, full-stack)</li>
  <li>• UI/UX designers for modern, clean mobile apps</li>
  <li>• Motion designers, illustrators & video creators</li>
  <li>• Social media creators, marketers & influencers</li>
</ul>

<h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-8">Experts & Advisors</h3>
<p className="text-slate-300 mt-2">
  We welcome conversations with people experienced in technology, consumer apps, AI-assisted product development, 
  digital wellbeing, and behavioural design. 
  We’re also open to connecting with intellectual property specialists for guidance around protecting technology and app- related innovations.
  We do not discuss sensitive or unprotected details publicly — all deeper conversations happen privately and under NDA if needed.
</p>

<h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-8">Investors & Strategic Partners</h3>
<p className="text-slate-300 mt-2">
  If you’re interested in early-stage consumer technology, calm digital experiences, or AI-powered creative tools, 
  we’re open to thoughtful early conversations as we shape our product family.
</p>

<h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-8">Early adopters & supporters</h3>
