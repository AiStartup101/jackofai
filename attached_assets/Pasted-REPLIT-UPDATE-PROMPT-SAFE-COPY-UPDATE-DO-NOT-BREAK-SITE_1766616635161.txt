REPLIT UPDATE PROMPT (SAFE COPY UPDATE — DO NOT BREAK SITE)

Goal:
Update JackofAI.com homepage copy + section structure to the new positioning (provided below), WITHOUT breaking routing, deployment, domain, nav links, existing forms, or “website connection”. Do NOT change hosting/DNS settings. Do NOT remove any existing pages or API routes. Only edit UI content/components.

Hard rules:
- Do NOT modify next.config, package.json, build scripts, DNS, domain settings, or deployment configs.
- Do NOT rename routes/pages (keep /, /products, /contact, etc. exactly as they are).
- Do NOT remove existing signup/early-access form logic or API endpoints (keep them working).
- Do NOT remove existing “Join Early Access” functionality—keep the same form component and endpoint; only adjust heading/subcopy.
- Keep existing header/nav, footer links, privacy/terms pages intact.
- Keep styling system (Tailwind/classes) intact; reuse existing components where possible.
- If there is a WhatsApp floating button widget, keep it enabled, but move it lower priority visually (do not show as a primary hero CTA).

What to change:
1) HOMEPAGE (route: / or app/page.tsx or pages/index.tsx)
- Replace hero + intro sections with new “Warm AI for real life” positioning.
- Reduce CTA clutter in hero: keep ONE primary CTA (“Explore our products”) that scrolls to products section. Keep “Join early access” as secondary below.
- Keep both product cards (ChristmasPulse, FamilyPulse) with single primary button each (“Visit ChristmasPulse”, “Visit FamilyPulse”). Keep existing external URLs exactly as currently implemented.
- Add a concise “Our point of view” section (philosophy) + “How we build” with 3 bullets.
- Keep Founder Note section but replace copy with the new founder note below.
- Keep Early Access section and form; update its headline/subcopy only.

2) PRODUCTS SECTION
- Ensure “Our products” section is above philosophy.
- Remove repeated “Coming soon” clutter (only show “Coming soon” badge once per product if you already have it; otherwise omit).

3) COLLABORATORS / WORK WITH US
- If the homepage currently contains a long “Work with us: talent & collaborators” block, do NOT delete the page/route that hosts it.
- On the homepage, either:
  (A) remove that long block from homepage and replace with one small line under Contact: “If you’d like to collaborate, reach out.” linking to existing /talent or /opportunities page, OR
  (B) collapse it into an accordion with a single summary line and a “Learn more” link.
Choose the option that requires the least code change.

4) FOOTER / CONTACT
- Keep contact details and footer links exactly. Do not remove legal links.

New homepage copy (use exactly, with minor formatting to fit existing UI):

HERO
Title: “Warm AI for real life.”
Body:
“JackofAI builds calm, consumer AI products designed around everyday human moments — not productivity, not noise, not feeds.
We start with celebration and family connection. We build slowly, thoughtfully, and with care.”
Primary CTA button: “Explore our products” (scrolls to products section id="products")
Secondary CTA: “Join early access” (scrolls to id="early-access" where the existing form lives)

SECTION: WHAT JACKOFAI IS
Heading: “What JackofAI is”
Body:
“JackofAI is a consumer product company.
We design and ship small, focused apps that feel human, emotionally clear, and easy to return to.
AI is present, but never the point. The experience always comes first.”

SECTION: OUR PRODUCTS (anchor id="products")
ChristmasPulse card:
Title: “ChristmasPulse”
Body:
“A warm, festive app for creating and sharing meaningful Christmas moments — cards, messages, and simple creative expressions.
Designed to feel joyful, personal, and calm.”
Button: “Visit ChristmasPulse” (use existing link)

FamilyPulse card:
Title: “FamilyPulse”
Body:
“A gentle app for everyday emotional connection within families — reflection, communication, and togetherness without pressure.
Designed for presence, not performance.”
Button: “Visit FamilyPulse” (use existing link)

SECTION: OUR POINT OF VIEW
Heading: “Our point of view”
Body:
“Technology works best when it stays in the background.
We believe people don’t need more apps — they need better ones. Calm is a feature. Emotional clarity matters more than feature depth.
So we build products that are intentionally small, emotionally grounded, and designed to support real life — not replace it.”

SECTION: HOW WE BUILD
Heading: “How we build”
Bullets:
- “Warm design — Interfaces feel human, intuitive, and emotionally considerate.”
- “Simple experiences — Fewer features. Clear intent. Easy to return to.”
- “Real connection — Technology should bring people closer, not compete for attention.”
Closing line:
“These aren’t brand values. They’re design constraints.”

SECTION: A NOTE FROM THE FOUNDER
Heading: “A note from the founder”
Body:
“I started JackofAI to build the kind of products I wanted to exist — tools that feel calm, human, and respectful of people’s lives.
The world doesn’t need louder technology. It needs technology that knows when to step back.
If what we’re building resonates with you, you’re welcome to follow along.”
Signature: “— Bhavik Patel”

SECTION: EARLY ACCESS (anchor id="early-access")
Heading: “Early access”
Subcopy:
“Our products are developed carefully and released gradually. Join for updates and early access invites.”
(Keep the existing email form + submit button + backend wiring unchanged.)

Implementation notes:
- Add section anchors (products, early-access) via ids on the relevant containers.
- Keep typography scale similar; do not introduce new fonts.
- Preserve mobile spacing and avoid adding too many new components—use existing Card/Section components.
- After changes, run typecheck/build locally in Replit and fix any TS/ESLint errors.
- Confirm that:
  - Homepage loads without errors
  - Product buttons still open the right URLs
  - Early access form still submits successfully
  - No routes were broken

Deliverable:
A single PR-style commit in the Replit workspace applying the copy/structure updates while keeping the site fully functional.
