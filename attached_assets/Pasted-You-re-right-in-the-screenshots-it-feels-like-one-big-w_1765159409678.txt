You’re right – in the screenshots it feels like one big wall of text, even though the content is good. Splitting it into clear blocks for each audience (builders, experts, investors, early adopters) will make it feel lighter and help the right people self-select fast.

Let’s turn it into 4 compact cards + one shared CTA row.

🔧 Replit prompt – refactor section into 4 clear blocks

Copy-paste this into the Replit AI agent. It will replace the current “Work with us” content with a more compact, card-based layout.

Hi Replit, 

Please update the “Work with us: talent & collaborators” section to be more compact and split into clear blocks.

1. In `app/page.tsx`, find the section that begins with:

<h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-16">Work with us: talent & collaborators</h2>

and currently includes the long paragraphs and lists for Talent & Creators, Experts & Advisors, Investors & Strategic Partners, Early adopters & supporters, and Share your details.

2. Replace everything from that <h2> down to (but not including) the “A note from the founder” section with the following:

<h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-16">
  Work with us: talent & collaborators
</h2>
<p className="text-slate-300 mt-4">
  We’re growing a small, intentional network of people who enjoy creating simple, human-centered digital products. 
  Whether you build, design, advise, invest, or test early ideas – we’d love to connect.
</p>

	3.	Keep the “Chat with the Founder” / “Email us” buttons that already exist below this section as they are, so people still have easy CTAs.

Please save all changes and rebuild/redeploy the site.

Thanks!

### Why this will feel better

- Same *meaning*, **half the perceived heaviness**  
- Four clear cards → each audience immediately finds “their” box  
- Safer visually: no one has to read a long block to know if they’re relevant  
- You still have **one simple intake flow** (email with bio + links)  
- It looks more premium and intentional on the page

Once this is live, we can do **small, focused pages** later (Experts, Early Access, etc.) if you want deeper detail — but the homepage will already be doing the right job.

If you show me a screenshot after this change, I can fine-tune wording/spacing one last time so it feels founder-perfect.
